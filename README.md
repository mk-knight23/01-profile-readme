## About

DevTools Engineer specializing in building developer-first platforms, agentic systems, and high-performance developer tooling. Currently building the **AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM v2.0** — a multi-product, agent-driven developer platform.

---

## 🏗️ What I’m Building

I am architecting **AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM v2.0**, a human-first developer platform where agents don't just write code—they collaborate within a unified system architecture. This ecosystem exists to bridge the gap between high-level intent and production-grade execution by treating AI as a first-class citizen in the developer's toolkit. This portfolio represents the **DevTools lens** into that system, focusing on the core interfaces that power the developer experience.

---

## 🧩 The AI-VIBE Products (DevTools Focus)

While the ecosystem spans 5 products, my work here focuses on the foundational tooling:

- **AI-VIBE-CLI & VSCode**: The primary interfaces for agentic collaboration. I focus on TUI/GUI parity, state-machine orchestration, and low-latency interaction.
- **AI-VIBE-Automation**: The engine that powers background tasks and workflow orchestration across the system.
- *Integrations*: Seamlessly connecting to **ChatWeb** and **WebBuilder** to ensure a unified DX from ideation to deployment.

---

## ⚙️ How This Portfolio Fits the Ecosystem

This portfolio demonstrates the **Developer Experience (DX)** layer of the AI-VIBE-ECOSYSTEM. It showcases how we build tools that developers actually want to use—keyboard-first, performance-optimized, and deeply integrated into existing workflows. It aligns with the **Automation → VSCode → CLI** workflow, where repetitive patterns are automated so engineers can focus on architecture.

---

## 🤖 Agents & Workflows I Use

In building this ecosystem, I leverage specialized agent workflows:
- **Architect & Planner**: Used to map out complex CLI commands and state transitions before a single line of code is written.
- **Code & Security Reviewer**: Ensuring that every tool generated by the ecosystem adheres to strict safety boundaries and performance benchmarks.
- **TDD Guide**: Driving the development of CLI utilities through rigorous test-first patterns.

---

## 💎 Design & Quality Principles

- **Human-First Development**: Tools should augment, not replace, human intent.
- **Security by Default**: Implicit trust is a bug; every agent action requires a clear audit trail.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Interfaces start simple but expose deep power for power users.
- **Performance Budgeting**: Every millisecond matters in DevTools; choosing vanilla JS over heavy frameworks was a conscious tradeoff for this site.

## Additional Features (vNext)

Six focused improvements aligned with DevTools engineering patterns:

### Keyboard Navigation
**Why added:** DevTools engineers live in keyboards. Navigation should respect that.

**What changed:** Arrow keys (↑↓←→) smoothly scroll between sections. Works intuitively—down goes to next section, up goes to previous. Ignores inputs when focused on form elements.

### Project Tag Filtering
**Why added:** Filtering is a core pattern in developer tools—from file trees to log viewers. It lets recruiters quickly find relevant projects.

**What changed:** Added filter buttons (All, Tools, React, Node.js, TypeScript) above the project grid. Filtering is instant with smooth show/hide transitions. Uses data attributes for clean implementation.

### Keyboard Shortcuts Modal
**Why added:** Every good CLI or IDE tool has discoverable keyboard shortcuts. This is a DevTools portfolio—it should demonstrate that philosophy.

**What changed:** Press `?` anywhere to open a keyboard shortcuts modal. Shows all available navigation commands. Closes with `Esc` or clicking outside. Small touch that signals keyboard-first thinking.

### Design Decisions Section
**Why added:** Senior engineers document tradeoffs. "Why" matters more than "what."

**What changed:** Added a new section documenting three key technical decisions: vanilla over frameworks, no dark mode choice, and monorepo strategy for VIBE. Each decision includes the reasoning and explicit tradeoff.

### Scroll Progress Indicator
**Why added:** Long portfolios can feel endless. A subtle progress bar gives you a sense of position.

**What changed:** A thin 2px line at the top fills as you scroll. Minimal—doesn't distract, just informs.

### Print-Optimized Styles
**Why added:** Recruiters often print portfolios or save as PDF for review.

**What changed:** `@media print` CSS hides navigation/footer, shows URLs next to links, ensures clean page breaks. Cmd+P produces a clean resume-style output.

### Intentionally Rejected: Search Bar
I considered adding a global search for projects. Rejected because with only 4 featured projects, filtering provides enough navigation without the complexity of a search implementation. The portfolio should remain simple and fast—principles I'd bring to any DevTools role.
